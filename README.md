Question: Does the % of influenza vaccinations pre covid (2019-2020) correlate to the % of Covid-19 Dose 1 Vaccinations (1 month, 6 months, one year) in US Counties?

Theory: We may be able to extrapolate based on our question whether or not people's willingness to take vaccines in general (the assumption is that influenza vaccines can represent "vaccines in general") impacts their willingness to take the Covid-19 vaccine? If so, how strong is this correlation and what might that say about the reasoning behind Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy?

Takeaway: There is a weak but noteable correlation between covid and influenza vaccine willingness. This may demonstrate that the hesitancy behind the Covid-19 vaccine may be unique to the Covid-19 vaccine, and that external covid vaccine related factors factors were more signifigant compared to vaccine hesitancy in general. This could demonstrate how people may be unwilling to rely on historical data when it comes to making decisions regarding similar but new advances.
